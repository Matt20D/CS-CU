# Data Structures in Java

Per my Professor's Academic Integrity pledge I am not allowed to post solutions to any of my assignments here. However, I will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com where I will provide you with a **url** to my **secret GitHub gist** for this course.

BigO-and-Generic
* Implemented generic classes and interfaces, linear search and recursive generic binary search algorithms, and Big-O Analysis.</li>

Stacks-and-Queues
* Created a symbol balance class that iterates through Java source code ensuring that syntax symbols match by utilizing stack data structures. Also, implemented a generic stack class, and a two stack queue.

Trees
* Used recursive algorithms to build and traverse nodes in an expression trees (postfix, prefix, and infix). For Binary Search Trees, I wrote algorithms that recursively mirror the tree, traverse and find "the smallest value greater than x", and "pretty print" the node values of the binary tree.

Maps-and-heaps
* Implemented a K-best algorithm and a spell checking class.

Dijkstra
* Determined optimal routing from city x to city y, highlighted in the Display.java GUI, using Dijkstra's greedy algorithm.
