# Artificial Intelligence
  
In this course, you will learn the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and apply them to the design and implementation of intelligent agents that solve real-world AI problems, including problems in search, games, machine learning, logic, and constraint satisfaction.

We will provide a broad understanding of the basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems.  Topics include the history of AI, intelligent agents, state-space problem representations, uninformed and heuristic search, game playing and adversarial search, logical agents, constraint satisfaction problems, along with techniques in machine learning and other applications of AI, such as natural language processing (NLP).

Per my Professor's Academic Integrity pledge I am not allowed to post solutions to any of my assignments here. However, I will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com where I will provide you with a **link** to my **secret GitHub gist** for this course.

There were five homework assignments:

	1. Python Review: solved various coding problems, with an emphasis on python data 
	   structures (lists, priority queues, graphs, sets, and more).
	   
	2. N-Puzzle Board Game: Implemented and compared breadth-first, depth-first, 
	   A-star search algorithms
	   
	3. Sudoku: Implemented backtracking search with minimum remaining value heuristic 
	   to reduce variables domains
	   
	4. 2048 Puzzle Game: Implemented an adversarial search agent to play using 
	   expectiminimax and alpha-beta pruning
	   
	5. Machine Learning: implemented Perceptron, Linear Regression, Clustering 
	   Machine Learning algorithms for data separation, prediction, and RGB values
