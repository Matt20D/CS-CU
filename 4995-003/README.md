# Engineering Software as a Service
  


Per my Professor's Academic Integrity pledge I am not allowed to post solutions to any of my assignments here. However, I will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com where I will provide you with a **url** to my **secret GitHub gist** for this course.

There were four homework assignments:

	1. echocat.cpp, Makefile
		*  

We also deployed a SaaS app on Heroku:  

	1. [InGame codebase](https://github.com/temo6cute/ingame)   
	2. [InGame website deployment](https://ingame-esaas.herokuapp.com)
