# Engineering Software as a Service
  
Technology trends not only enable software to flourish, but also fundamentally change our software engineering process. Broadband access enables developers to run their software in the cloud for users to access via browsers or mobile apps -- so-called Software-as-a-Services (SaaS). The developers of SaaS products continuously gather user feedback and behavior analytics, quickly refine existing or build new product features, and deploy to production in matter of minutes to test out their ideas -- so called Agile Development. This style of close collaboration with customers and fast iteration of product ideas is in stark contrast with how software was engineered two decades ago.

In this course, we will study modern software engineering practices including including topics such as SaaS architecture, behavior-driven and test-driven development, Ruby on Rails, and Dev/ops. The general goal of this course is to help you learn the skills and practices to build modern software products and services. We believe that the tremendous advance in technology now makes it much easier to create software products today.

Per my Professor's Academic Integrity pledge I am not allowed to post solutions to any of my assignments here. However, I will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com where I will provide you with a **url** to my **secret GitHub gist** for this course.

There were five homework assignments which introduced us to ruby, rails, rspec, cucumber, and the agile development life cycle:

	1. ruby-intro
		* 2-5-chips--ruby-intro
	2. test-driven development with rspec, and REST API
		* 3-7-chips--hangperson
	3. rails-intro
		* 5-2-chips--rails-intro
	4. behavior-driven development with cucumber
		* 7-7-chips-bdd-cucumber
	5. acceptance life cycle
		* 8-9-chips--acceptance--lifeCycle

About our Application: 

Our main project was the deployment of a SaaS app on Heroku. Over a series of four iterations, we utilized agile development key concepts to refactor, refine, and produce our final deployed application. All of the code is located in the InGame codebase (link below), which is a private repo. I would have to grant permission to see the code, and would gladly accept any requests.

Mission Statement: 

Our application is called InGame, where gamers have a place to share and store in-game stills or live clips that they have created using gallery mode developer tools.

As gaming hardware has evolved, video game graphics have followed suit. Gaming studios have also developed advanced screen capture functionality and gallery modes that allow the gamer to screenshot in game moments. These features have evolved to the point where gamers are a burgeoning content creation market. This “new media art” allows gamers to produce their own art within the detailed sandboxes that studios have dedicated years of development time to. By putting this power into the hands of the user, gamers can push the limits of the game’s intended use to create art and save their in game achievements. Graphics nowadays are so finely tuned that its impossible to discern fiction from reality. As the market for this content grows, there will need to be a place where you store, refine and share your content.

It is time for you to display your talent, welcome to InGame.

Codebase:

	1. InGame codebase: https://github.com/temo6cute/ingame  
		* private repository, would need permission to access it! But I would be open to sharing
		to anyone that is interested
		
 	2. InGame website deployment: https://ingame-esaas.herokuapp.com  
		* gamers, feel free to signup!

	3. Agile Developments:
		1. proposal
			* arguing why our app should exist
		2. iteration-1
			* Minimum Viable Product with basic features
		3. iteration-2
			* Minimum Viable Product with main features
		4. iteration-3-demo
			* Minimum Viable Product with all features
		5. iteration-4-launch
			* Final deployed application with polished UI/UX design
