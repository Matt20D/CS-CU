# Engineering Software as a Service
  


Per my Professor's Academic Integrity pledge I am not allowed to post solutions to any of my assignments here. However, I will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com where I will provide you with a **url** to my **secret GitHub gist** for this course.

There were four homework assignments:

	1. echocat.cpp, Makefile
		*  

We also deployed a SaaS app on Heroku:  

	1. InGame codebase: https://github.com/temo6cute/ingame  
		* private repository, would need permission to access it! But I would be open to sharing
		to anyone that is interested
		
 	2. InGame website deployment: https://ingame-esaas.herokuapp.com  
		* gamers, feel free to signup!
