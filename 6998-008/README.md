# Cloud Computing and Big Data
  
Learned about how to design serverless, asynchronous, scalable systems that can handle high loads using cloud microservice architectures. We focused on AWS, but the principles apply to other cloud providers. The decoupled nature of microservice system design allows for systems to perform well at scale. Further, we experimented with cutting edge resources and learned how to utilize logging, asynchronous triggers, message queues, NoSQL databases, as well as big data tools such as Map Reduce and Spark. These tools allow us to utilize the full capabilities of the cloud in order to design asynchronous systems that are decoupled and scalable, and can perform big data operations on massive datasets.

per my professor's academic integrity pledge i am not allowed to post solutions to any of my homework assignments here. However, i will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com where i will provide you with a **link** to my **secret github gist** for this course.

Surfworld Project: Built a sleekly designed web app that provides value to avid surfers, 
by aggregating surf specific data by the world's popular surf breaks and other third-party 
APIs. We provide the data in an easy to digest way, allowing surfers to search for data 
near their location (using geo-locations) or by searching for specific places. We leveraged 
AWS cloud services in order to build a fully decoupled system that could scale to a large 
number of users.

Project Deliverables:

Course Projects (Private Repo):
	1) Chatbot: Implement a serverless, microservice-driven web application. Specifically, 
	you will build a Dining Concierge chatbot that sends you restaurant suggestions given a 
	set of preferences that you provide the chatbot with thorough conversation.
	
	2) Photo Album: Implemented a photo album web application that can be searched using 
	natural language through both text and voice. You will learn how to use Lex, ElasticSearch,
	and Rekognition to create an intelligent search layer to query your photos for people, 
	objects, actions, landmarks and more.

	3) Email Service: Implemented a machine learning model to predict whether a message 
	is spam or not. Furthermore, you will create a system that upon receipt of an email 
	message, it will automatically flag it as spam or not, based on the prediction obtained 
	from the machine learning model.
