# Introduction to Databases
  
This is a first course on databases, focusing on how to use a database management system and design a database effectively. No prior exposure to database systems is assumed. This course is a prerequisite for the more advanced courses 4112 and 6111. The course will focus on relational databases, but will also touch on object-relational databases, graph databases, and NoSQL. These are the following topics that were covered: Entity-Relationship modeling, relational model and relational algebra, SQL, security, NoSQL, key-value stores, document stores, BigTable, Streaming data, Graph Databases, Object-relational databases, storage and indexing, query processing and optimization, transactions, normalization, serialization.

	3. Web interface
	4. Object-oriented features

There were four homework assignments:

	1. E-R modeling, relational algebra
	2. SQL, security
