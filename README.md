# Columbia Computer Science Coursework

This CS portfolio contains a selection of the best projects I completed during my time at Columbia University. 
All of the code that is contained is mine alone (unless specified) and cannot be copied without my consent. For
certain courses I was **unable** to post code on this public repo and it is **marked accordingly**. If you would like
to see the code for those courses, send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com, where I will provide you
with a **url** to my **secret github gist**.
