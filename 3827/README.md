# Fundamentals of Computer Systems

This course examines how the 1s and 0s that form the foundation of digital computing are organized, structured, and manipulated to produce full-fledged computer systems. In bridging this gap, the course will cover many subjects beginning with binary logic, combinatorial and sequential circuit design, memory structures, instruction set architectures, and, ultimately, basic processor design.

The content is organized into six modules:   

        1. Binary information, boolean algebra, and combinational logic   
        2. Combinational circuit design   
        3. Sequential circuit design   
        4. MIPS assembly language   
        5. Single-cycle MIPS processor   
        6. Pipelined MIPS processor and caches   

Per my Professor's Academic Integrity pledge I am not allowed to post solutions to any of my assignments here. However, I will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com. I can provide you with a link to a **secret github gist** that contains my MIPS solutions.

There were twelve homework assignments:

        1.  Logic, binary and hex, circuits
        2.  Truth tables, de morgan's law, karnaugh maps, minterms and maxterms
        3.  Circuit properties (critical path, propagation and contamination delays), 
            timing diagrams, building circuits with the minimum number of gates
        4.  Advanced circuits using multiplexers, encoders, and decoders
        5.  Finite state machines, state transition diagrams, and clock circuit timing
        6.  Finite state machines, state transition diagrams, and clock circuit timing
        7.  Finite state machines, state transition diagrams, and clock circuit timing
        8.  Intro to MIPS assembly programming **(Have MIPS source code in a github gist)**
        9.  MIPS looping, recursion, pointers  **(Have MIPS source code in a github gist)**
        10. Converting mips assembly code instruction to machine code
        11. Single cycle processor
        12. pipeline processor, and caching
