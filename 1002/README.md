# Computing in Context

Per my Professor's Academic Integrity pledge I am not allowed to post solutions to any of my assignments here. However, I will detail the themes for each assignment and if you would like to see it send me an **email request** to mduran2429@gmail.com where I will provide you with a **url** to my **secret GitHub gist** for this course.

Bulls and Cows   
* User plays against CPU to guess the secretly and randomly generated number. The CPU provides helpful cues along the way, such as how many bulls (correct digit in the correct location) and how many cows (correct digit in incorrect location) the user guessed. The game ends when the user gets 4 bulls, i.e the CPU's secret number.

* Analyzed NYC parking ticket data from NYC Open Data to determine which year had the highest outstanding dollar balance, which license plate was the offender, and which diplomatic consolate had the highest outstanding parking tickets balacne.</li>   

Computational Finance  
* Monte Carlo Simulation and option pricing.   

Schelling's Model of Segregation
